    <h6>Personally Identifiable Information</h6>
    <p>
      Throughout our Website, you may voluntarily submit information that
      personally identifies you ("Personally Identifiable Information"). In
      general, you can visit our Website without telling us who you are or
      sharing any Personally Identifiable Information about yourself except as
      follows. We only collect Personally Identifiable Information about you if
      you choose to share it with us. For example, you may choose to provide
      Personally Identifiable Information by contacting us via Email or the
      contact form on our website. Personally Identifiable Information may
      include, but is not limited to, your name, Email address, physical
      address, phone number, and messages that you can send to us.
    </p>
    <h6>Anonymous Usage Data</h6>
    <p>
      Like many other websites, ours may collect anonymous usage data
      ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information") about your activity at this
      Website. We may store information about the type of browser you are using,
      your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the time, date, and length of your
      visit; and the referring site. This information is collected via computer
      code sent to your computer (commonly referred to as a "cookie"). The
      cookie will not expire, unless you manually delete it or set your browser
      to reject it. If you do not accept the cookie, however, you may have
      difficulty navigating our full Website.
    </p>
    <h6>Use of Information</h6>
    <p>
      We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to manage this Website. We
      may analyze aggregated anonymous information on the pages visited by our
      users to make our Website more accessible and useful. Further, we may
      share this data with third parties, usually to provide services for
      Sabrina Andres Art Consulting associated with the maintenance of the
      Website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except as outlined in this Privacy Policy or on the Website, Sabrina

      information for the purpose you requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we may share this information with third parties to fulfill
      your request or to provide other services that may be of interest to you.
      If you do not wish Sabrina Andres Art Consulting to use your information
      in this manner, then do not submit any Personally Identifiable Information
      to us. In addition, Sabrina Andres Art Consulting may disclose Personally
      Identifiable Information about you if we believe in good faith that the
      law requires it (such as a subpoena, court order or a law enforcement
      request), or if we reasonably believe it is necessary to protect our legal
      interests. The information collected from you may be transferred to a
      third party in the event of a sale, acquisition, merger or bankruptcy
      involving us.

    <h6>Links to Other Websites</h6>
    <p>
      For your convenience, our Website may contain links to other websites
      whose information and privacy practices are probably different than ours.
      If you choose to use these links, you will leave our Website, and will
      then be subject to the privacy and information practices of those
      websites. We do not control and are not responsible for any of their
      content or their privacy policies, if any. We do not endorse or make any
      representations about them, or any information, software or other products
      or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using

    <p>
      We employ commercially reasonable security measures to reduce the risk of
      unauthorized access to your Personally Identifiable Information. However,
      we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to
      protect against all efforts to gain unauthorized access to that
      information.
